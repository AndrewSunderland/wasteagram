# wasteagram

Premise:
Wasteagram is a Flutter Application that helps keep track of food waste that restaurants might produce. The idea is that when staff throw away food, they log it in the application by taking a photo and entering the number of food items. The app then keeps track of these posts so the restaurant may see how much food is going to waste.

Features:
Wasteagram can capture photos from the user's mobile photo gallery on their respective mobile device.
When submitting a post the phone will also provide the app with the users geolocation to be stored with the post.
The photos are stored on Google's Firestore Storage.
The posts store the relavant data and photo URL in Google's Firestore Database.
